## About Parity UI

Parity UI is a User Interface desktop application for [Parity Ethereum Client](https://github.com/paritytech/parity/blob/master/README.md) >=v1.10. In order to use Parity UI, you must have [Parity Ethereum Client](https://github.com/paritytech/parity/blob/master/README.md) >=v1.10 installed on your system. 
By default Parity UI will listen to any running Parity client on your system and connect to it. If none was found, a Parity Ethereum Client process will be launched in background and connect to Ethereum mainnet.

If you run into any User Interface related issue while using Parity UI, feel free to file one in this repository or hop on our Gitter or Riot chat room to ask a question. We are glad to help!

You can download Parity UI at https://github.com/parity-js/shell/releases/latest or follow the instructions below to build from source.
